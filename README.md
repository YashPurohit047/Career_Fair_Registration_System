- I prepared a prototype registration system for EduFair - Career Fair of my School.
- Tech Stack Used - Java(At Front-end),MySQL as DBMS(At Back-End) Development Tools - NetBeans IDE

While developing the project, the hardware used are:
A PC with Pentium® Dual-Core Processor (2.80 GHz) with 1 GB RAM, SVCAand other necessary devices.

## Important Steps Before Running the Program:
- The MySQL server must have username as **root** and password as **rootcap**.
- If root password is any other password, it can be changed by running MySQL Server Instance Configure Wizard.
- Start -> Program -> MySQL -> MySQL Server -> MySQL Server Instance Config Wizard.
- Provide current password of root and new password as rootcap, this will change the root password.
 
* **Also Before running the project the Database should be prepared by the help of the sql file attached with the project. the file attached is named as "mysqlcode.sql".**
